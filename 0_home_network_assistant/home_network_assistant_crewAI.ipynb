    "1. The workflow starts with information retrieval. We create a knowledge base, and store the information from the `Home Network openAPI spec` into the knowledge base. The OpenAPI spec is provided by the user in the `data` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. This knowledge base will be wrapped within a lambda function that will be invoked based on the user query. It will `retrieve` the top `k` results from the knowledge base and send it as an input to the next step.\n",

    "1. Next, a `Home Networking` assistant agent will have access to the required API specs to use to generate code. It will use the information from the Knowledge base and generate code for the given API spec, save the code and execute the code based on the parameters provided by the user."
